# Project-Gutenberg-Language-Processing
Project Gutenberg is a volunteer effort to digitize and archive cultural works, and at present, contains over 50,000 books, all previously published and now available electronically to "encourage the creation and distribution of eBooks". Most of the items in its collection are the full texts of public domain books.   In this project, we examine the properties of individual books in a book collection from various authors and various languages. More specifically, we looked at book lengths, number of unique words,and how these attributes cluster by language of or authorship.
